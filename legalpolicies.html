        <p>MOLKA CRIMES ARE OFTEN PUSHED UNDER THE RUG. </p>

      <p>There is also not much legal structure in place to address molka footage circulation even if perpetrators have been found guilty. Police have also let offenders go in molka crimes where there was a lack of physical violence. The rapid development of digital technology and the digital permanence of circulation of illegal molka content makes it difficult for a victim to recover damages even with proof of wrongdoing.</p>


      <p>Some existing reprecussions include:</p>

      <p>1. Up to 5 Years in Prison</p>
      <p>2. Fined Up to $26,500 USD</p>
